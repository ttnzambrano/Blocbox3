Likes.  Nice appearance with the lovely logo.
Embedded screen shot is interesting along with the photo as background.

Ease of use.  Large easy to find buttons.

Overall design... Clean large multi page design.

What would you change.  Not sure I like the computer screen being cut off with
the white section.

Feedback...Buttons are green but sign in /sign up are not green.  Not sure
they are links as they are the same color as the text on the rest of the page.
